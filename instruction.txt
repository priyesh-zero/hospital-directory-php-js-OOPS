-- in case of errors in the task don't hesitate to tell us about this immediately --  

1) check the structure of files in /js, /mvc and /php folders
2) open /directory.php with php server
3) check the html code of this page, the way sidebar and main view are included
4) go into mvc/directory and check the files there.
   In our project we have a strict component formation.
   The standard component consists of three formal types of files which are:
      - Controller (js code, a js class with the same name as a component name in CamelCase)
      - Module (php code and api for the component)
      - View (html code with php insertions from Module)
5) as now you know the basic file structure, check the code of all those elements.
   When the page is loaded, the basic template gets the 
      - /php/index.php file (has the PDO and other helper functions inclusions)
      - /mvc/directory/index.php file (the main file of the component used for inclusion of all component files)
   /mvc/directory/index.php includes:
      - /mvc/directory/view/directory-sidebar.php
      - /mvc/directory/controller/Directory.js 
      - /mvc/directory/controller/Directory.js (puts it into the <script> tag by means of include_js() function from /php/HelperFunctions.php)
6) Your goal is to:
   a) create a t_patient, t_hospital and t_city tables in the database with the following rows:
      t_patient:
        idPatient (int 11)
        patName (varchar 255)
        patLastname (varchar 255)
        patPhone (varchar 20)
        patGender (char 1) - m / f
        patBirthDate (date)
        patEmail (varchar 255)
        fkCity (int 11)
      t_hospital:
        idHospital (int 11)
        hosName (varchar 255)
        hosPhone (varchar 255)
        hosUrgentPhone (varchar 255)
        hosFax (varchar 255)
        hosEmail (varchar 255)
        fkCity (int 11)
      t_city:
        idCity (int 11)
        citName (varchar 255)
  b) create 3 fake data instances for each table
  c) take the value from the input in sidebar 
    and form the request in /mvc/directory/controller/Directory.js to 
    /mvc/directory/module/api-directory.php in getPatients() and getHospitals() methods
    with input value. 
    The "input" event listener should trigger the action after 500 milliseconds.
    The action should be triggered on document ready
  d) work on functions called from /mvc/directory/module/api-directory.php to give an html response
